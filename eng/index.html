	<h2>Welcome, dear visitor!</h2>
	<h4>This is the personal website of a young naturalist, artist, translator and aspiring scientist, used to share independent projects such as visual identification guides, scientific illustrations/figures, translations, and so on. All context on this website is free to use for educational or scientific purposes, as long as you provide appropriate credit.</h4>

	<section class="half"><h5>What are your main scientific interests?</h5>
	<p>Learning as much as I can about the natural world around me is my main purpose in life. My biggest interest lies in Hepaticology, the study of liverworts (and hornworts). My other major interests are Arthropodology, Taxonomy and Systematics, and Organic Chemistry. I also take intersest in interdisciplinary studies such as Chemosystematics, the classification of living organisms based on their chemical composition.</p>
	<p>The aforementioned topics will be the main ones on this website, and I'm looking forward to sharing materials pertaining to them here. I am very passionate about citizen science, and my main goal is to create projects
	that will be useful not only to myself but to everyone else who takes interest in the natural world, professionally or not!</p></section>
	<section class="half"><h5>What kind of creature is that on the sidebar?</h5>
	<p>This is <i>Phytozoon sp.</i>, a fictional organism from my science fiction project. You can think of it as a mascot of this site. It's a small (5 cm long) critter that combines in itself the features of a liverwort,
	specifically <i>Zoopsis setulosa</i>, and a millipede, taxonomically classified as a Bryopodian. Bryopodians are intricately genetically modified
	inhabitants of the exoplanet MOOS-74b, created by an alien race using the DNA of Earth organisms. If you are interested in this project of mine,
		feel free to check out its <a href="bryopodia.html">dedicated page</a> on this website!</p></section>
